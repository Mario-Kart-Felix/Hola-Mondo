# Hola-Mondo
am using link to generate deep linking. I am using their public API's endpoint to generate links.

Here is their endpoint: https://api.branch.io/v1/url

I append my branch key and data that I need to associate in this link. Everything is working fine but I need to expire this link within one hour.

Reading up here: https://github.com/BranchMetrics/branch-deep-linking-public-api#creating-a-deep-linking-url

I added "duration" key also, but it didnt expire the link.

It will be great if anyone could help me in figuring out how to expire branch.io link.
